                <h2 class="two">English</h2>
                <p>English is a West Germanic language first spoken in early medieval England, which has become the
                    leading language of
                    international discourse in the 21st century. It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient
                    Germanic peoples
                    that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name, England. Both names derive
                    from Anglia, a
                    peninsula on the Baltic Sea.</p>

                <h2 class="three">Japanese</h2>
                <p>Japanese is an East Asian language spoken by about 128 million people,
                    primarily in Japan, where it is the national language. It is a member of the Japonic language
                    family, and its ultimate derivation and relation to other languages such as Korean is unclear.
                    Japonic languages
                    have
                    been grouped with other language families such as Ainu, Austroasiatic, and the now-discredited
                    Altaic, but none of
                    these
                    proposals has gained widespread acceptance.</p>
